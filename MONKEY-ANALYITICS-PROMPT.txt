READ THE TRANSCRIPT 
Here are the menu options: 
Cookies and Creme Waffle 
Berry Bliss Waffle 
Matcha Latte 
Hot Coffee 
Chocolate Foam Coffee / Iced Latte with Chocolate Foam
Hot Chocolate 
Strawberry lemonade 
Ube Coffee 
Pina Colada 
Dalgona Coffee 

Ensuring That Different Discriptions of Menu Items are Acceptable: 
Can you make a list of different ways people can refer to the above menu items? And take those into consideration when anaylzing the transcript later. 
If the coustomer mentions a product that is not exactly the name of the products on the menu, 
attempt to inference if the customer is refering to a product using differnt words or if they are saying something irrelevent.  

Input Data Required: 
Did the customer consent to the Survey? 
Yes - Increase the Counter for # of Surveys Completed 
No - Stop, no data collection required. 

Overall Service Rating: 
Reading the Entire Survey, was the overall review of the Cafe Positive or Negative? 
LOGIC: Go through each question and check if the answer to the question is positive or negative. Then see in total , did most of the surveys have positive reviews or negative ones? 
Overall Positive - raise the positive service rating counter 
Overall Negative - raise the negative service counter by one 

Product Ratings: 
Can you look through the transcript and see if the customer mentioned any of the products on the menu? 
If so for each product can you tell me if the customer was positive or negative about each product. 
LOGIC: provide me a list of each product mentioned by the customer and whether the product had a positive or negative review. 

Customer advice and expectations: 
Did the customer mention any improvements they would suggest or their expectations on the service or how the cafe should be run or advice on products? 
LOGIC: provide a summary of key words of advice that the customer mentioned by quoting their words and summarizing key ideas that the customer presents. 
**If the customer does not give any insight do not provide a summary.**

Give me both a generative answer and a JS file of the input data I required. 

Write the JS file in this formatt:
